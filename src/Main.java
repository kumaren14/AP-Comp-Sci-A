	/*I'd like to call attention to some of the bits and bobs I am using to make my output easier to read.
	I've used "println();" methods instead of "print();" methods to move my output off of the same line.
	I've also used \n combinations to get a neat linebreak within a single text of code, so that I
	don't have to type out "System.out.println("");" all over again.
	Finally, I've also used a \" before and after the letter "P" in my text. This is to add in quotation marks
	to the output, as a regular quotation mark wouldn't work.
	Finally, at the top of the page you can see that I have created a one line comment by starting with a //
	And here, I created a multi-line block comment by starting and ending it with a /*
	I'm excited to continue coding!
	*/
